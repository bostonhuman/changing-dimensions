# Changing Dimensions
This example demonstrates how the .height() and .width() methods can be used to retrieve and update box dimensions. These methods allow you to discover or update the width and height of all boxes on the page. If you set the width or height of the box in CSS, it does not include any padding, border, or margin - they are added to the dimensions.
